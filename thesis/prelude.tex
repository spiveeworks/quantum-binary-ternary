Quantum computation is the study of how quantum mechanics can be utilised to reliably compute or simulate results that are significantly harder to compute by classical means. Existing quantum computation research focuses overwhelmingly on binary quantum logic, the logic of the `qubit', due to this being both the simplest and the most familiar number system for performing computation. Quantum computation does not have to operate with binar quantum data, however, and calculation is theoretically possible with ternary `qutrits', or higher, or even with quantum systems that utilise a mixture of binary, ternary, or other quantum logic systems simultaneously. These systems might store data more efficiently, might scale more rapidly and might present richer or more novel techniques for calculation, or might prove detrimental; we need to develop a theory of non-binary quantum logic in order to answer these questions.

In this thesis we present a detailed description of what a quantum algorithm is and the basic operations available to a qubit computer, before discussing existing literature surrounding proposed devices and algorithms for computation on ternary or `qutrit' computers. We then convert these existing ternary algorithms into algorithms that act on mixed quantum computers, with access to both qubits and qutrits. After this we describe a basic set of gates already known to be capable of performing generic or universal computation on binary quantum computers, and generalise these to mixed quantum computers as well. After this we present the results of a basic algebraic search implemented in the C programming language, for finding finite and infinite groups of quantum operations, and finally discuss the many novel implications of what was found and questions for future research prompted by these findings.
