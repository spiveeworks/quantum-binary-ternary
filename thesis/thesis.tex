% Note that the following defaults are also contained in the 'report' class
% (this is not exhaustive...see appropriate references for all options)
% 'oneside' mode...overide with 'twoside' to force output for two-sided printing.
% 'final' mode...overide with 'draft' to see linebreak malfunctioning.
% For example, to use two-sided printing one would declare the 'documentclass'
% as follows...
% '\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,twoside]{report}'
%
% Specific Mathematical options are as follows
% 'leqno' to force equation numbering on the left side of the page.
% 'fleqn' to force formulas to flush left (centered is the default).
% If 'fleqn' is specified then the left indent is controlled with '\mathindent'.
% i.e. '\setlength{\mathindent}{2.5cm}'

% Declare overall type of document (use 11pt report class on A4 paper).

% 'makeidx' for generating the index
% 'tocbibind' for adding table of contents entries for bibliography, index etc.
% 'sectsty' for generating stylised chapter and section headings.

% During thesis writing you might only want to see the pdf of the current chapter rather than the entire 
% thesis. However, you will want to ensure page numbers, chapter numbers, and referencing is maintained 
% for the entire thesis. 
% In the main section below, between \begin{document} and \end{document} you can use the \include{}
% command to specify all of the components (other .tex files) of the thesis. 
% Prior to \begin{document} you can use \includeonly{} to specify which of those components you want to 
% see. You can comment out files that you will include later or have already finished to speed
% up TeX processing. Comment out the \includeonly{} command to see the entire thesis.
